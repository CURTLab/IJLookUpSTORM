# LookUpSTORM

LookUpSTORM is an 3D real-time single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) fitting algorithm that uses lookup tables for subpixel emitter fitting.

This is an example implementation for ImageJ 1.x.

# Algorithm

The lookup table is populated templates (e.g. 2D elliptical Gaussian functions) that approximate the point spread function (PSF) of the optical measurement system. 


# Tested prerequisites for compilation
* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2019
* Java 1.8 + Maven 14.0.0 in NetBeans IDE 8.2
* ImageJ 1.53h
